# RFM-analysis-of-ecommerce-dataset
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to group and rank customers based on recency, frequency and monetary parameters of their transactions at the store and segment the customers for their targeted marketing campaigns.
1. Recency.  How recent was the customer's last purchase which can be measured in days, months ,years etc.
2.Frequency. How often did this customer make a purchase in a given period? 
3.Monetary. How much money did the customer spend in a given period? Customers who spend a lot of money are more likely to spend money in the future and have a high value to a business.
